# FoodLab

This is an Android app (written in Java) that I created in a class I took at my university. Additionally, I conducted market research and user studies to cater towards my target audience both in terms of functionality and UI/UX. 

## Purpose

The average American household throws away 16% of the food it buys (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015), equating to about $640 per year. This is because people believe they need fresh ingredients to make flavorful meals and then end up tossing unused ingredients. 

After conducting surveys and interviews, found that roughly 50% of survey takers do not believe they have much experience at cooking (with most of the remaining considering themselves at an intermediate level) and 70% of survey takers cook off of recipes and the majority of beginners cook off of recipes every time that they do cook. Additionally, 80% of them do not use a cooking app of any sort.

The purpose of this app is to not only reduce the amount of food waste every single year, but also the amount of money wasted when food ingredients are not utilized. The app will do this through providing recipes for users based on ingredients he/she already has in his/her possession. It will try to present these recipes in a clear and concise manner to allow for users to obtain favourable results.

## Features

This app primarily features a search bar where users are able to input ingredients, delimited by commas, to obtain recipes that use the most ingredients provided (given the recipes in the Spoonacular API's database). These rrecipes can then be sorted by relevancy (how many ingredients are used), rating (out of 5 stars) or time needed. After clicking on each recipe, the user can then view the ingredients on one fragment, instructions on another, and tips/comments on the last fragment (and from there, add his/her own). Users will also be able to view pictures of these recipes and add them to his/her favourites.
